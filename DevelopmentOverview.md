# Development Walkthrough
1. Researching different load balancing algorithms (Round Robin, Least Load, etc).
2. Implementing each algorithm in C-Sharp to compare performance.
3. Selecting the most efficient approach and optimizing it.
4. Finalizing and merging the best implementation into the main branch.

# Load Balancing Algorithms to Explore

    A. Round Robin (RR): Assigns tasks cyclically to processors. Simple but doesnâ€™t consider current loads.
    
    B. Weighted Round Robin (WRR): Assigns more tasks to powerful processors based on weight factors.
    
    C. Least Connections: Assigns tasks to the processor with the fewest active connections.
    
    D. Least Load: Assigns tasks to the processor with the lowest CPU utilization.
    
    E. Randomized Load Balancing: Assigns tasks randomly, useful for evenly distributed workloads.
    
    F. Threshold-Based Balancing: Uses predefined thresholds to migrate tasks from overloaded processors.
    
    G. AI-Based Load Balancing: Uses machine learning to predict and distribute workloads dynamically.
